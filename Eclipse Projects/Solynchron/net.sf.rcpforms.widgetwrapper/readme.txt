The rcpforms plugin delivers best practices and a powerful, easy-to-learn API
for creating forms with data binding an validation.

It is no alternative to existing eclipse apis, but makes them much easier
to use.

There is not too much documentation yet, best you start with the
RCPWidgetsManualTest.java class in the net.sf.rcpforms.widgetwrapper.test plugin
or the ExampleFormPart class to get an idea how the API feels.

You can just start them as java application, they dont need osgi runtime started.

A more sophisticated example is in the net.sf.rcpforms.examples plugin,
class SandboxStackForm. 
You can start it as swt application with one view or you can start it as SWT application.
Launch configurations are provided for both launch alternatives.

A wiki will be built up here:

RCPForms is meant to be used and extended;
if you have any generally useful extension, e.g.

- more sophicisticated builders using TableWrapLayout or FormLayout
- improvements in table editing support
- new widgets for date/phone/email

and so on, please contribute them. 

Enjoy !
